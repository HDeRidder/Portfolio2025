                    <h3>Who is Harold?</h3>
                    <p>Let me start by introducing myself a little more extensively; I am a 25-year old optimist who comes from a family that loves to laugh. Together with my parents and 2 sisters I live in the beautiful and peaceful Pajottenland (Flemish Brabant). As a child, I always wanted to become an inventor, build machines that would make people's lives easier or improve the world. It is therefore not illogical that throughout my life I have been fascinated by technology, innovation and new ideas.</p>
                    <p>In addition, -largely due to my father- I have cultivated a tremendous love for nature, growing my own vegetables and restoring or creating ecosystems. I am convinced that both of the above are useful and much needed in a world in change. Although balancing the two is not always easy....</p>
                </div>
                <div class="about-block">
                    <h3>Why IT and this orientation of choice?</h3>
                    <p>To become an inventor you first of all need to be creative and inventive. Fortunately, I already had these characteristics by default. Due to my permanent curiosity and the urge to constantly learn, my knowledge of the world grew enormously as a child. I devoured books and could not be turned away from "museums" like Technopolis, Hydrodoe, Da Vinci Museum and you name it. If it involved something or other of experimentation or testing something out myself I was a fan.</p>
                    <p>I was given various do-books, building kits and experimentation kits to get started on my own, until in high school when I first heard of Arduino, a world-renowned type of microcontroller that was ideal for the novice electronics enthusiast, which was me. I ordered a beginner's kit and soon I had finished almost all the projects. I knew: I love this, I want to know more and get better at it.</p>

                    <h3>Future Dreams & Professional Ambitions</h3>
                    <p>My dream is to lead innovative IoT projects that improve quality of life and sustainability. I aspire to work internationally, collaborate with diverse teams, and eventually mentor the next generation of engineers. My ambition is to contribute to smart cities, healthcare, and green technology through impactful, user-centered solutions.</p>
                    <p>As for the future, I don't really know yet. I know that I would really like to take another big trip. This could be through Europe, although Iran and the Middle East also seem wonderful to me. Unfortunately, that will probably have to wait until the dust settles there. After this trip, I would like to seek out a job in the IoT sector, preferably in combination with working outdoors or at least something where I come into contact with plants or animals. I myself am thinking of perhaps eventually starting my own company that provides customized IoT solutions specifically aimed at automating and monitoring greenhouses and vegetable gardens in people's homes. But who knows what the future holds!</p>
