            <h3>Context & Background</h3>
            <p>For the course Embedded Devices Essentials we worked with three students—Mathieu Du Jardin, Jens Geenen and myself—on the project Weatherballoon & Backup Network. After some lessons on the ESP32 microcontroller and its programming in C, we chose this project: a weather balloon that measures environmental data and acts as a node in a mesh network.</p>
            <p>Each balloon had to send data via Wi-Fi and communicate with other balloons via LORA. LORA (LOng RAnge) is a wireless communication technology that covers greater distances than Wi-Fi. Our idea: during disasters, multiple balloons would be launched to establish a temporary network that allowed emergency workers or victims to communicate locally and access info such as air quality.</p>
            <p>We named our project—LORA The Explorer—with a wink, via ChatGPT. Both functional and funny.</p>

            <h3>Realization</h3>
            <p>We were excited and dove headfirst into LORA, mesh networks and weather balloons. The challenge was not only designing the system, but also developing our own PCB and even building the ESP32 module from scratch. For this, we used EasyEDA, software for PCB design.</p>
            <p>Soon we discovered how complex it was to design a microcontroller completely on our own. A small error in the schematic could have disastrous consequences. Due to time constraints, we had to order an alternative ESP32 chip last-minute, which unfortunately turned out to be obsolete in retrospect.</p>
            <p>Our PCB looked good, but did not work as hoped. Only after help from Roma, a sympathetic technician from Georgia whom we found through Facebook, did we get the chip partially working. Unfortunately, this came too late to complete the project.</p>

            <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Working with EasyEDA and designing my own electrical schematics.</li>
                <li>PCBs with some complexity require a lot of time and care.</li>
                <li>Build a working test setup first before ordering a PCB.</li>
                <li>Check components and data sheets carefully; avoid obsolete parts.</li>
                <li>Online communities are very valuable for technical problems.</li>
                <li>Observing deadlines is crucial, especially for orders with long lead times.</li>
            </ul>
